## Azure AD App Registration

### Step 1: Access Azure Portal

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account

### Step 2: Create App Registration

1. Search for **"Azure Active Directory"** in the top search bar
2. Click on **Azure Active Directory** from the results
3. In the left sidebar, click on **App registrations**
4. Click the **+ New registration** button

### Step 3: Register Application

Fill in the registration form:

1. **Name**: Enter a name (e.g., "HPH-BHARAT-Asset-App")
2. **Supported account types**: 
   - Select **"Accounts in this organizational directory only"** (Single tenant)
3. **Redirect URI**: Leave blank for now (we'll add it later)
4. Click **Register**

### Step 4: Copy Your IDs

After registration, on the **Overview** page:

1. **Copy the Application (client) ID** - This is your Client ID
2. **Copy the Directory (tenant) ID** - This is your Tenant ID

**Save these values!** Both are in GUID format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

## Configure API Permissions

### Step 1: Add Microsoft Graph Permission

1. In your app registration, click on **API permissions** in the left sidebar
2. Click **+ Add a permission**
3. Select **Microsoft Graph**
4. Choose **Delegated permissions**
5. Search for and select:
   - `Sites.ReadWrite.All`
   - `User.Read` (usually already added)
6. Click **Add permissions**

### Step 2: Verify Permissions

You should now see:
- ✅ Microsoft Graph: `User.Read` (Delegated)
- ✅ Microsoft Graph: `Sites.ReadWrite.All` (Delegated)

**Note**: The app uses Microsoft Graph API, so you don't need SharePoint Online API permissions.

---

## Configure Redirect URI

### Step 1: Find Your App's Redirect URI

1. Open your app in the iOS Simulator
2. Look at the connection screen
3. You'll see a section showing **"Redirect URI:"**
4. It will show something like:
   - `exp://localhost:8081` (iOS Simulator)
   - `exp://192.168.x.x:8081` (if using network IP)

**Copy this exact URI!**

### Step 2: Add to Azure AD

1. In Azure Portal, go to your app registration → **Authentication**
2. Under **Platform configurations**, click **+ Add a platform**
3. Select **"Mobile and desktop applications"**
4. Click **Configure**
5. In the **Redirect URIs** field, paste the exact URI from your app
6. Under **"Implicit grant and hybrid flows"**, check:
   - ✅ **Access tokens** (ID tokens)
   - ✅ **ID tokens**
7. Click **Save**

### Important Notes

- The redirect URI must match **exactly** (protocol, host, port)
- You can add multiple URIs if needed
- Common URIs: `exp://localhost:8081` or `exp://192.168.x.x:8081`
- The redirect URI may change if your network IP changes

## Admin Consent

### Why Admin Consent is Required

`Sites.ReadWrite.All` is a high-privilege permission that requires admin consent to protect organizational data.

### Option 1: Grant Admin Consent in Azure Portal (Recommended)

1. Go to Azure Portal → Your App → **API permissions**
2. Click **"Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]"** button
3. Click **Yes** to confirm
4. **Wait for the page to refresh**
5. Verify the **Status** column shows:
   - ✅ **"Granted for [Your Organization]"** with green checkmarks for all permissions

### Option 2: Admin Signs In During Authentication

If you see the "Need admin approval" screen:

1. Click **"Have an admin account? Sign in with that account"**
2. An admin signs in with their admin account
3. They grant consent when prompted
4. After this, the app will work for all users

### If You Don't Have Admin Access

Ask your Azure AD administrator to grant consent. Send them:

**Subject: Admin Consent Required for SharePoint App**

Hi,

I need admin consent for the Azure AD app registration "[Your App Name]" to access SharePoint.

**Required Action:**
1. Go to Azure Portal → Azure AD → App registrations → [Your App Name]
2. Click "API permissions"
3. Click "Grant admin consent for [Organization]"
4. Confirm

**Permissions Needed:**
- Microsoft Graph: Sites.ReadWrite.All (Delegated)
- Microsoft Graph: User.Read (Delegated)

This is a one-time action that will allow all users in the organization to use the app.

Thank you!

## Troubleshooting

### Step-by-Step Verification Checklist

1. ✅ **Configuration Valid**
   ```bash
   npm run validate-config
   ```

2. ✅ **Redirect URI Added to Azure AD**
   - Check the URI shown in your app
   - Add it to Azure Portal → Authentication → Redirect URIs
   - Must match exactly

3. ✅ **API Permissions Configured**
   - Microsoft Graph: `Sites.ReadWrite.All`
   - Microsoft Graph: `User.Read`
   - Admin consent granted (Status shows "Granted for [Organization]")

4. ✅ **Correct Account**
   - Using account with SharePoint access
   - Account in same tenant as app registration

5. ✅ **App Registration Active**
   - App exists in Azure Portal
   - Not disabled or deleted

### Common Issues

#### "Need admin approval" Screen

**Problem**: Admin consent hasn't been granted.

**Solution**:
- Grant admin consent in Azure Portal (see [Admin Consent](#admin-consent) section)
- Or have an admin sign in during authentication

#### "Authentication cancelled by user"

**Problem**: Usually redirect URI mismatch or browser closed.

**Solution**:
- Verify redirect URI matches exactly in Azure AD
- Don't close the browser during authentication
- Complete the sign-in process

#### Missing Permissions

**Problem**: Only `User.Read` is configured.

**Solution**:
- Add `Sites.ReadWrite.All` for Microsoft Graph
- See [Configure API Permissions](#configure-api-permissions) section

#### Redirect URI Mismatch

**Problem**: URI in Azure AD doesn't match app.

**Solution**:
- Check exact URI shown in your app
- Compare character-by-character with Azure AD
- Update Azure AD to match exactly

#### "Access Denied" or "Forbidden" Errors

**Possible Causes:**
1. Admin consent not granted
2. User doesn't have site permissions
3. List has unique permissions restricting access
4. User account is not in the correct tenant

**Solutions:**
1. Check admin consent status in Azure Portal
2. Verify user has Edit/Contribute permission on the site
3. Check list permissions (Settings → List settings → Permissions)
4. Verify user account tenant matches app registration tenant

## Common Errors

### "invalid_client"
- **Cause**: Client ID is incorrect or app registration doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Verify Client ID in `config/sharepointConfig.ts` matches Azure Portal

### "invalid_tenant"
- **Cause**: Tenant ID is incorrect
- **Fix**: Verify Tenant ID in `config/sharepointConfig.ts` matches Azure Portal

### "invalid_grant"
- **Cause**: Redirect URI mismatch or code already used/expired
- **Fix**: 
  - Verify redirect URI matches exactly
  - Try connecting again (codes expire quickly)

### "AADSTS50020"
- **Cause**: User account not found in tenant
- **Fix**: Use an account that exists in the Azure AD tenant

### "AADSTS70016"
- **Cause**: Application not found in the tenant
- **Fix**: Verify the app registration exists in the correct tenant

### "AADSTS70011" / "scope is not valid"
- **Cause**: Invalid scope combination
- **Fix**: Use only Microsoft Graph scopes (already configured in the app)

### "AADSTS90014" / "required field 'request' is missing"
- **Cause**: PKCE code verifier issue
- **Fix**: Usually resolves automatically. If persists, clear app cache and retry

### "insufficient_privileges" or "Access Denied"
- **Cause**: Permissions not granted or not consented
- **Fix**: Grant admin consent in Azure Portal → API permissions

## Technical Details

### Authentication

- **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE**: Industry-standard secure authentication
- **Token-Based**: Short-lived access tokens (stored in memory)
- **User Context**: All actions are performed as the authenticated user
- **Delegated Permissions**: App acts with user's permissions, not app-only

### API

- **Microsoft Graph API**: Modern API for accessing SharePoint
- **Endpoints**: Uses Graph API endpoints like `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{siteId}/lists`
- **Data Format**: Standard JSON (no OData verbose format)

### Security

- ✅ **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE**: Secure authentication
- ✅ **Token-Based**: No stored credentials
- ✅ **User Context**: All actions tied to authenticated user
- ✅ **Delegated Permissions**: No elevation of privileges
- ✅ **Scope Limited**: Users can only access data they have permission to see

---

## Additional Notes

- The app uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication
- Tokens are stored in memory (consider implementing token persistence for production)
- The form includes a default "Title" field which is required in most SharePoint lists
- You can add custom fields dynamically in the form
- Admin consent is organization-wide and only needs to be done once
- The app uses Microsoft Graph API (not SharePoint REST API)
